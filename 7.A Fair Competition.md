# A Fair Competition

Swifter, Higher and Stronger stands for the spirit of the Olympics. But fairness is the basis of this motto. Only when you win fairly will you and your homeland deserve the great glory. But nowadays, unlike the ancient honest slave competitors, some hopeless athletes who can't bear the pain in training cheat when they take part in games. Medals seem to have magical power causing them to cheat, and prize money has replaced the motto as their only goal.
