Hiding behind the loose dusty curtain, a teenager packed up his overcoat into the suitcase. He planned to leave home at dust though there was thunder and lightning outdoor. He had got to do this because he was tired of his parents' nagging about his English study and didn't want to go through it any longer. He couldn't get along well with his English study and dislike joining in any English classes because he thought his teacher ignored him on purpose. As a result, his score in each exam never added up to 60.

His partner was concerted about him very much. She exactly understood what he was suffering from, but disagree his idea. In order to calm him down and settle his problem, she talked with him face to face and swapped a series of learning tips with him. The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well.

The teenager was grateful and got great power from his friend's words. Now, he had recovered from being upset and had fallen love in English.

A Hard Trip
My sister was fond of traveling. Ever since graduating, she had been determined to organize a trip to an old temple. Since the transporting fare was expensive, she decided to use a bicycle to cycle there no caring about the disadvantage. Her stubborn attitude was her shortcoming. Once she made up here mind to do something no one could persuade her to change her mind. Finally we gave in as usual though we preferred to take a train. After we prepared everything, include the schedule, reliable weather forecast and the insurance, we began our trip.

Our journey was along a river flowing from a high altitude. Our pace was slow because the river had frequently sharp bends through deep valleys, which the water seemed to boil. Just as I recorded in my journal, it was a hard journey. But we also enjoyed great views. One night I put my head on my pillow - a parcel of wool coat, and lay beneath the stars. When the flame in front of our cave went down at midnight, I found the sky so beautiful.

Horrible Earthquake
Dirty water rose in wells and canals before the earthquake. But no one judged that an earthquake was coming. Suddenly, everything shook. Millions of bricks houses and a number of dams were destroyed. Railway tracks became useless bars. Pipes in mines burst and let out smelly steam. Huge crack trapped cyclists everywhere.

The next day, this event was the headline or main title of all newspapers. With the reporters giving an outline of this disaster, the whole nation was shocked with the damage and the victims' suffering. People were moved when they read that the survivors comforted each other by saying,"Congratulations! You survived!". So they not only expressed sympathy sincerely, but also organized together to help the survivors. The injured were rescued and the dead were buried. The frightened survivors were dug from under the ruins, and offered shelter, fresh water and electricity. Thanks for people's help, the lost were minimized.

The Great President
As the founder of the republic, the president had many good qualities. Before coming to power, he was a generous lawyer. He accept no fee to selflessly offer legal guidance and opinions to those who were out of work or uneducated. As believing mankind to be equal, he devoted himself to stopping unfair anti-black laws. He set up the Black Youth League and was voted to be the leader. However, though he kept peaceful principle without violence and terrors, his mean enemies still blew up his house and attacked his relatives, and he himself couldn't escape being sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Not fearing of the prison guards' cruelty, he kept active and begged no mercy from them. As a matter of fact, he was always hopeful and never lost his heard during the stage even though he was in trouble.

Finally, people rewarded him with the leader's position and a gold blanket.
