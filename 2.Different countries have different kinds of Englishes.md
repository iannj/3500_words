# Different countries have different kinds of Englishes

Voyages of people from England play an import part in spreading English language. At present, English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many countries, such as American, Singapore, Malaysia and some African countries. All based on British English, the English spoken in these countries can be well understood by native English speakers. But Actually, the Englishes have been gradually changing in accents, spellings, expressions and usage of vocabulary.

Because of this fact, you can make use of the differences to tell which country the foreigners of your block are from. For example, if a boss fluently commands his driver, "Come up straight to my apartment by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs." instead of requesting,"Please come to my flat by lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis." you can recognize his American identity, while the latter suggests that his is British.
