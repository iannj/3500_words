# Fall In Love With English

Hiding behind the loose dusty curtain, a teenager packed up his overcoat into the suitcase. He planned to leave home at dusk although there was thunder and lightning outdoors. He had got to do this because he was tired of his parents's nagging about his English study and didn't want to go through it any longer. He couldn't go along well with his English study and disliked joining in English classes because he thought his teacher ignored him on purpose. As a result, his score in each exam never added up to 60. 

His partner was concerned about him very much. She understood exactly what he was suffering from, but disagreed with his idea. In order to calm him down and settle his problem, she talked with him face to face and swapped a series of learning tips with him. The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well.

The teenage was grateful and got great power from his friend's words. Now, he has recovered from being upset and has fallen in love with English.
