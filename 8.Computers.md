# Computers

The goal of early calculating machines was to simplify difficult sums. But with the help of new technology, electronic chips replaced tubes and a revolution of artificial intelligence has arisen. From then on, the appearance of computer changed our lives. They can not only download information from net when connected network or mobile phone signal, but also solve different types of logical problems. They can even control the rocket to explore the moon and instruct androids with human race's character to mop the floors and watch over your naughty niece. Anyhow, computers are so helpful that they do bring happiness.

However, computers are easily attacked by viruses. This reality has become a hard-to-deal with-problem. As a result, computers are dangerous in a way. So personally, I worry about their universal applications in some fields, such as finance.
