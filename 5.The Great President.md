# The Great President

As the founder of the republic, the president had many good qualities. Before coming to power, he was a generous lawyer. He accept no fee to selflessly offer legal guidance and opinions to those who were out of work or uneducated. As believing mankind to be equal, he set up the Black Youth League to stopping unfair anti-black laws. However, though he kept peaceful principle without violence and terror, his mean enemies still blew up his house and attacked his relatives, and he himself couldn't escape being sentenced to 30 years in prison.
