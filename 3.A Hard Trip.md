# A Hard Trip

My sister was fond of traveling. Ever since graduating, she had been determined to organize a trip to an old temple. Since the transporting fare was expensive, she decided to use a bicycle to cycle there not caring about disadvantage. Her stubborn attitude was her shortcoming. Once she made up her mind to do something, no one could persuade her to change her mind. Finally, we give in as usual though we preferred to take a train. After we prepared everything including schedule, reliable weather forecast and insurance, we began our trip.
